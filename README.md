# Brain_tumor_detection-using-VGG16-transfer-learning
his project implements a brain tumor classification model using Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture. The goal is to detect brain tumors from MRI images by leveraging a pre-trained convolutional neural network, significantly improving accuracy with limited data and computational resources.
